# The art of "Listening"
Don't you felt an awkward moment during an conversation "why the person is not listening to me and responding or keep on saying before I complete??" This is called as listening deficiency.

What exactly happens when you listen something, it happens to me, you and every human being as our brain internal circuity is build on same concepts. When we listen there is a lot of noise (also known as thoughts) goes inside our brain which blocks the actual sound of conversation; and we say suddenly "can you please repeat again!". It mayn't be all the time we ask this question because we blocked from other noise inside our brain but it happens many time and you might be thinking "YES" now.

Why aren't we able to listen effectively though we present and actively participate at any place? It happens to every human bring as we can't control our thought process which comes inside our brain during every second of the day and night which comes from various backgrounds starting from past, future and other circumstances around us which impact our life every day. If you have a bad incident in the morning then those thoughts comes during the day and in some cases few days also which is spontaneous and impact listening and makes us less productive.

Why listening is an important skill in the current age of communication where we live and breath in technology around us, where we always hear sound (may be I would say noise) from twitter feed, WhatsApp message, to Facebook post but listen very little. As Stephen R Covey said “Most people do not listen with the intent to understand; they listen with the intent to reply.” which is much true if we consciously observe much of our conversations every day.

You might be thinking now that how can can we learn the skill of listening?
Is it really a subject to learn? and the answer is absolutely YES. In fact skill of listening is mostly over shadowed part of communication where much focus is on effective writing and speaking. In fact if you search in Google its same - word "art of listening" gives result of 34,300,000 compare to 246,000,000 for "art of speaking"; Here is the Fact.

The skill of listening in fact comes over the period of time with conscious listening (not to music/songs). What I mean conversation with persons at home, office, coffee shop and anyplace. Sometimes we urge to respond during the conversation but pause your thoughts!! and back to listening then respond at the end. This is a skill which need to build over the period and we will feel much different in the conversation as we feel present at the moment which makes us productive and complete the task effectively.

First we need to take few minutes to listen ourself or listen inward with the moment of silence. There are few ways we can practice to filter various of noise to measure effectiveness of listening. Here are the amazing TED talks on the skill listening.

Thanks for reading the article and a listener without any voice. Feel free to share to make our society a better place to listen each other.
